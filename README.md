ellyn
=======

ellyn is a Python-wrapped version of [ellenGP](http://www.github.com/lacava/ellen) that allows ellenGP to play nice with sci-kitlearn. ellyn's parameter settings are totally accessible from the commandline, whereas ellenGP relies on a parameter file. This can make batch jobs less tedious. 

ellyn is a genetic programming tool for symbolic regression and multi-class classification that incorporates epigenetic learning and uses a stack-based, linear representation.

ellyn also inherits the `BaseEstimator` class used by [sklearn's](http://scikit-learn.org/) supervised learning modules. That means that ellyn can be used with that environment of tools, including the hyperparameter optimization tools and cross validation tools.

ellyn is also very fast due to its c++ underpinning. As a consequence, there are two library dependencies: [Boost](http://www.boost.org) and [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), that need to be installed in order to make the ellyn library for python usage.

Head over to the [docs](https://epistasislab.github.io/ellyn/) page for more info. 

Install
=======

Using conda and the included environment file is easiest.

```bash

git clone http://github.com/EpistasisLab/ellyn

cd ellyn

conda env create environment.yml

conda activate ellyn-env

python setup.py install
```
